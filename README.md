# SASOS

The aim of this project is to build an automated crop recommendation system using machine learning to improve accuracy and efficiency in selecting optimal crops. By analysing soil and climate data, this system will support data-driven crop choices, addressing challenges like inconsistent data quality and diverse datasets.
- The project could lead to several significant outcomes, including increased agricultural productivity through optimized resource use, such as precise water and fertilizer application.
- Proper utilization of land reduces wastage and promotes high crop yields, which in turn can contribute to the reduction of global warming.
- Additionally, farmers would benefit from enhanced decision-making capabilities, leading to more sustainable practices, improved crop yields, and potentially higher profitability.
- Real-time data insights could also facilitate proactive responses to weather changes or pest outbreaks, further improving farm resilience.
